## Description of the course
In this course, we want to provide students with direct research experience at the hydrothermal system of Milos (Greece). This hydrothermal system is a shallow analogue to deep sea vents, and an ideal place for students to be trained in systemic hydrothermal investigation. Students with background in marine geophysics, macrobiology, geomicrobiology and geochemistry will work together to achieve a global understanding of the system, allowing them to understand how minerals are formed and how to assess the potential ecological impact of exploiting these resources (see figure below). They will be involved with actively contested questions, empirical observation, cutting-edge technologies, and the sense of excitement that comes from working to answer important questions. By the end of this course, students will have learned the process leading to thorough and rigorous scientific investigation, including result presentation and discussion.

## Introduction meeting
The video of the online introduction meeting (15th of September 2023) can be found [here](https://filesender.sikt.no/?s=download&token=f5e083e4-a4c4-4ef7-bcd8-bad012ceb3dc). The link expires the 7th of October.

## Organisation
_Flights_  
These are the flights booked for the students and employees from UiB. By now you should have received by sms your flight information. Remember that you have to organise by yourself the transport to and from the airport.

_Hotels_  
On Friday 13th and Tuesday 24th, we will all sleep in Athens. We cover the cost for everyone, including non-UiB students.  
The booking is at my name (Sven Le Moine Bauer). You can go there as soon as you arrive in Athens. Being responsible (see below) does not mean much, I just had to give a name for each room.
- On the 13th, we will sleep in 3 different hostels that are in the same corner (see stars on the map below).
  - Male students sleep at Sparti:
    - Room 1: Eirik Valdar (responsible), Ole Jøsok, Kristian Fjeld
    - Room 2: Liem Østrådt-Jennings (responsible), Ole Bratshaug, Jack Maley, Eirik Siira
  - Female students sleep at Ionion:
    - Room 1: Amalie Johannessen (responsible), Brenda Vasquez, Anna Sørensen, Susann Ruediger
    - Room 2: Stine Grindheim (responsible), Jule Krohn, Joely Maak
  - Teachers sleep at Electra:
    - Room 1: Sven Le Moine Bauer (responsible), Steffen Jørgensen, Bjarte Hannisdal
    - Room 2: Susanne Bauer (responsible), Heidi Meyer 
- On the 24th, everyone sleeps at Ionion:
    - Room 1: Amalie Johannessen (responsible), Brenda Vasquez, Anna Sørensen, Susann Ruediger
    - Room 2: Liem Østrådt-Jennings (responsible), Ole Bratshaug, Jack Maley, Eirik Siira
    - Room 3: Stine Grindheim (responsible), Jule Krohn, Joely Maak
    - Room 4: Eirik Valdar (responsible), Ole Jøsok, Kristian Fjeld
    - Room 5: Steffen Jørgensen (responsible), Bjarte Hannisdal
    - Room 6: Heidi Meyer (responsible)
- For the hotel on Milos, each of us will share the room with someone else. I had expected to have two different beds in each room, but sadly this is not the case, and I got to know last week that we will actually be sleeping in double beds. The rooms are as follows: Amalie J. and Brenda V., Liem E. and Kristian F., Anna S. and Stine G., Areti B. and Susann R., Jule K. and Joely M., Ole J. and Jack M., Eirik S. and Eirik V., Ole B. (alone), Steffen J. and Bjarte H., Sven LMB and Thibaut B., Heidi M. and Eirini A., Susanne B. and Paraskevi N., Stephanos K. and Othonas V.

_Transport to Milos and back_  
All students (and most teachers) will take the boat from Piraeus the saturday 14th at 07:40. We arrive at Milos at 11:00. There we will have cars and drive everyone to Paleochori.  
For the way back, most students (except Areti), and Bjarte/Steffe/Heidi will take the boat on tuesday 24th at 16h55. Arrival at Pireaus at 20h15, and night at the Ionion hostel.

_Costs_  
The costs for the hotel in Athens the 13th and 24th are covered by the project for everyone.
- Each UiB student and the teachers have to pay pay 2000 NOK or 180 EURO to Sven Le Moine Bauer at the start of the course (on the boat to Milos). This is to participate for the food costs. The payment can be made in cash (in EURO), or through vipps to 98187251.
- Each non UiB student should pay for the food participation (180 EURO), the boat to Milos and back (150 EURO), and the hotel on Milos (350 EURO). Please pay in cash to Sven Le Moine Bauer on the boat to Milos.

Note that the rest of the food costs (around 50% of the costs) will be covered by the project.

_Food_  
In Athens, you are organising your dinner yourselves.  
On Milos:
- For breakfast, we will provide some food that we bought at the supermarket: Bread, marmelade, muesli, milk, juice,...  
- For lunch, we will get some sandwiches from the restaurant (they have been notified for allergies).  
- For dinner, we will eat at the restaurant Pelago, by the beach. The food there will be paid by the project directly, but you pay for your drinks.  


## Things to bring with you for the course
Here is a list of things you should remember to take with you. Feel free to share other things on the discord that I may have forgotten!
- Snorkeling equipment: Snorkel, mask, fins, wetsuit. A watch that can go in the water is very useful too.
- Sun screen + sun glasses.
- Laptop.
- Some cash may be useful. Remember you will have to pay 175 euro as participation to the food costs on your arrival there.
- You do not really need it, but a camera is nice, ideally one that can go under water!
- Earplugs... remember that you are sharing your room!
- We will be far from any supermarket, and the supermarket on Milos looks like a Bunnpris on Sunday. So if you have your little guilty pleasure snack that you cannot survive without more than a couple of days I advise you to bring it from home!

## Freediving
Following some Norwegian legislation, students and employees hired in Norway won't be allowed to freedive. The following section is therefore only relevant to the other members of the course.

In order to retrieve samples and data, we will be freediving every day. The area studied will be less than 5 m deep, and while it is not needed to be able to go down (you can send your colleagues), it would still be more enjoyable to have some basics of freediving.  
The main problem one will face when going down to 5 m is equalisation. Ideally you would like to learn to use Frenzel equalisation, which you can by looking at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxdEvyrKatc), or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo07gZR741M). There are also many more tutorials on the net. If you can't do it, no worries, we will work on it on Milos.  
The second important thing is to try to stay longer under water. For this, it is important to learn to breath properly using your diaphragm. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADdqYzcBeLw&start=934). As well, you can learn to better tolerate the high amount of CO2 in your body. To do so, lie on your couch/bed, and after relaxing and taking a nice last big breath in, hold your breath until the first contraction comes. Take one breath, and start again. Repeat 8 times. You can also do the same thing while walking, but be a bit more tolerant: take maybe 5 breaths between each breathold. Don't walk too fast, and try to relax as much as possible.  

Freediving is a safe activity when done following some rules, but can also go very wrong otherwise. We have written a [risk assessment](RiskAssessment.md) that everyone should familiarize themselves with.  
REMEMBER: NEVER TRAIN IN THE WATER ALONE!
