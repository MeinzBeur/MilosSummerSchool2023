Hi all!  
I'm Heidi and I will be leading the Macrobiology side of things. I am from the USA but have been living in Bergen for the past 5 years. 
I did my PhD at UiB where I analyzed ROV visual data to describe the communities on an arctic seamount. I am now working at IMR doing image cataloguing for the MAREANO project. 

For the macro side of the course, we will be doing some ROV surveys and analyzing the visual data collected using an online and free software called BIIGLE. 
This is a cool program that allows for collaboration between users, different types of annotations depending on the research question, and is very user friendly.  

## Preparation
I need you to make a BIIGLE account ASAP as it sometimes takes a few hours for the BIIGLE team to approve the new user, and closer to the course I will make a project and put on some sample images so you can test out annotating on BIIGLE, although if you wish you could always upload some sample images yourself too. You can make a biigle acount [here](https://biigle.de/). Once you get your biigle account all set up and approved, you can join my biigle project for the course [here](https://biigle.de/project-invitations/610b7e9d-8354-4d13-8ecc-ff40a7f9ec7c).

You can read up more on BIIGLE [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00083/full)  and [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7728927#.ZBSUlHbP1PY).  

Here are some relatively short tutorials (about 10 minutes or less) I just made on how to get started in BIIGLE and what you can do with BIIGLE. You can access it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1ukhzHa8cF10gamlC-SR4uJ7wA8yajw?usp=sharing).

## Project description
_Objectives_
- Map the communities around the shallow water vent fields around Milos.
  - Question: How does the megafaunal community change with proximity to the vents?
  - Things to think about:
    - What are the dominant taxa 0 m from the vents, 10 m from the vents, 25 m from the vents, 50 m from the vents?
    - How does the substrates influence the community structure?
    - Is there a vast difference in communities between active and inactive areas?
   
   
_Itinerary_
- Day 1: Overview on methodology and training in BIIGLE
  - What is BIIGLE
  - What is image and video analysis
  - Video vs Image annotation
  - Photomosaicing
  - OTUs
  - What to think about when conducting underwater surveys for quantitative analysis
  - Introduction to SmartarID
- Day 2-3: Data collection with ROV, prepping dataset for BIIGLE, making labels
  - Day 4-6: Annotation of visual data
  - Day 7-8: Data analysis
- Outputs
  - Species list with respective image catalogue
  - Uploaded reference images to SmartarID

When planning surveys with BlueROV, it is important to have reference points throughout the videos as there are no GPS coordinates.
